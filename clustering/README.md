# Measure the clustering 

We use the script `xirunpc.py` used in DESI to measure the clustering of the galaxy catalogs.

Pre-requisites:
- [LSS](https://github.com/desihub/LSS): This code only works on NERSC, in the DESI environment. 

We try the following measurements:
- log-bin, s=0.01-30 Mpc/h (notice clustering measurement at s>40Mpc/h is forbidden before the key project is finished.)
