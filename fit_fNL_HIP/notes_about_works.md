Here we describe the works done with the codes in this directory.

1. `QSO_box_z3`: as the first test. Use the prior of $p$ estimated from the 100 HOD sampled from the posterior of `base-A` HOD model. However, the data is the best-fit HOD of `base` HOD model. The results show a 2-$\sigma$ bias in the inferred $f_{\rm NL}$.
