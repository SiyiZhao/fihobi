# Works

Here we describe the works done with the codes in this directory.

1. `QSO_box_z3`: as the first test. Use the prior of $p$ estimated from the 100 HOD sampled from the posterior of `base-A` HOD model. However, the data is the best-fit HOD of `base` HOD model. The results $f_{\rm NL}=132\pm 17$ show a 2$\sigma$ bias in the inferred $f_{\rm NL}$. Since the $p$ we measured from the 'data' mock is $1.19\pm 0.35$, and the central value we used for prior is ~2$\sigma$ biased.
2. `QSO_box_z3_base-A`: the first 'serious' work. Use the prior of $p$ estimated from the 100 HOD sampled from the posterior of `base-A` HOD model, and the data from the best-fit `base-A` HOD model. The results $f_{\rm NL}=109\pm 18$ are consistent with the true value $f_{\rm NL}=100$. The $p$ we measured from the 'data' mock is $1.83\pm 0.34$, which is with in the 1$\sigma$ range of the prior we used, $1.884\pm 0.1056$.
