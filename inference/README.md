# Inference

We run inference with desilike 


The standard analysis pipeline fixes $p=1$ for LRG and $p=1.6$ for QSO. 
However, we want to test whether the data^[small scale clusterings for each tracer and each redshift bin] prefer different values of $p$. To do this, we run inference with $p$ as a free parameter while fix $f_{\rm NL}$ to the simulation settings.

## Box tests

### LRGs at z0.5, fNL=30
